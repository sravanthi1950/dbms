In this PL/SQL block:
 The variables num1, num2, and num3 are initialized with values 10, 20, and 15 respectively.
 The IF statement checks three conditions: if num1 is greater than or equal to num2 and num3, if 
num2 is greater than or equal to num1 and num3, and if neither of the previous conditions are true (i.e., 
num3 is the greatest).
 Depending on the condition met, the greatest number is assigned to the variable greatest.
 Finally, the result is printed using DBMS_OUTPUT.PUT_LINE.


Sample Output:
The greatest number among 10, 20, and 15 is: 20
